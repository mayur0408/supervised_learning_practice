# supervised_learning_practice
Have projects based on supervised machine learning techniques
I sometimes refer my old notebook for solving a usecase i have encountered before.
This repository contains some of my work which i have done from past year.
The data set used here were taken from kaggle.
I have used various machine learning algorithms along with various techniques of data manipualation and data visualization.
If you find anything wrong please contact me !
